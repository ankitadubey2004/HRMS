# 👩‍💼 HRDS – Human Resource Dashboard System

HRDS is a role-based web application designed to streamline HR operations including employee management, attendance tracking, leave requests, and performance monitoring. Built with a focus on clarity, responsiveness, and secure access, the system supports Admin, HR, and Employee roles with tailored dashboards and workflows.

As part of my Software Developer Internship, I developed key frontend components and integrated them with backend APIs to provide seamless user experiences across multiple roles.
